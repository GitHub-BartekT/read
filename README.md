# $${\color{red}{do-read}}$$
The **do-read** app helps children learn to read by playing short, 
focused reading sessions before watching cartoons. 
This method is inspired by Glenn and Janet Domanâ€™s book 
and aims to reduce the time parents spend preparing learning materials while keeping children engaged.

## How it works
### Problem
In the book *How to Teach Your Baby to Read*, the Domans describe a method to teach toddlers and preschoolers to read. While the daily learning sessions are short, 
the preparation takes a lot of effort, leading many parents to abandon the method over time.
### Solution
Most children regularly watch cartoons. **do-read** integrates reading lessons into their screen time, where parents can play brief reading sessions that align with the Domansâ€™ teaching methods.
