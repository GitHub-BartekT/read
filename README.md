# $${\color{red}{do-read}}$$
The **do-read** app helps children learn to read by playing short, 
focused reading sessions before watching cartoons. 
This method is inspired by Glenn and Janet Doman‚Äôs book 
and aims to reduce the time parents spend preparing learning materials while keeping children engaged.

## How it works
### Problem
In the book *How to Teach Your Baby to Read*, the Domans describe a method to teach toddlers and preschoolers to read. While the daily learning sessions are short, 
the preparation takes a lot of effort, leading many parents to abandon the method over time.
### Solution
Most children regularly watch cartoons. **do-read** integrates reading lessons into their screen time, where parents can play brief reading sessions that align with the Domans‚Äô teaching methods.

## What Has Been Accomplishedüí°
### Architecture ‚úÖ
The app follows a **clean, modular hexagonal architecture**:
* REST API endpoints.
* Some HTML files are static, while others are MVC templates.
* Security integration is based on a separate repository.
#### Modules:
#### Business Modules
* Module:
  * Manages individual modules, which consist of sets of sentences.
  * Responsible for:
    * Setting the current lesson.
    * Defining the number of sentences displayed per session.
    * Storing module-related data, such as the number of daily sessions, newly learned sentences, and sorting data by session number.
* Sentence:
  * Implements business logic related to managing sentences within user modules.
  * Main tasks:
    * Storing: Stores sentences in the context of specific user modules.
    * Sorting: Sorts sentences according to a predefined order (e.g., ordinalNumber).
    * Modifying: Allows modifying the content of sentences and their attributes.
    * Deleting: Manages the deletion of sentences assigned to user modules.
* Session:
  * Combines individual modules into learning sessions.
  * A session represents a set of actions performed within a single module, such as reviewing, revisiting, and learning new sentences.
  * Manages user progress within lessons, for example, controlling which sentences have already been learned.
#### Infrastructural Modules

### Database‚úÖ
* PostgreSQL database.
* Migrations managed by **Flyway**.
* Designed with an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for reference.
